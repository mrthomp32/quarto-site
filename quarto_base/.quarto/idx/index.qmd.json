I teach courses on Chinese politics, the political economy of development, and research methods in social science.\n\n::: column-margin\n![Me, smiling the smile only successfully defending your dissertation can bring.](post_grad_beers_small.jpg)\n:::\n\nI received my Ph.D. in Political Science at the University of Michigan, where I also received an MA in Chinese Studies. From 2023 to 2025, I served as a Postdoctoral Scholar at the UC San Diego School of Global Policy and Strategy's 21st Century China Center.\n\nWhen I am not on campus, I can be found walking my rescued racing greyhound, writing blog posts I will never publish, and hunting for rare[^1] books.\n\n[^1]: If you ever suffer the misfortune of hearing about my book collection, you will quickly discover the difference between 'rare' and 'valuable.'\n\n## About my work\n\nGenerally, my research focuses on bureaucracy and the evolution of administrative-legal institutions. I also have methodological interests in the analysis of text and in mixed-methods social science. Empirically, I am interested in the cases of China under the Communist Party of China and martial-law era Taiwan.\n\nYou can read more specifics about my research and teaching by clicking the tabs above.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":"fenced","output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"self-contained":true,"reference-location":"margin","output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.280","editor":"visual","theme":"lumen","title":"","citation-location":"margin","grid":{"margin-width":"350px"}},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
