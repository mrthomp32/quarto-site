I have focused on trying to collect and clean continuous runs of newspapers, publications, and other temporally-granular sources for understanding the changing political and social landscape.\n\nMy work on Taiwan primarily relies on publicly-available but redistribution-restricted archival material that I can't freely redistribute here.\n\nFor any researchers curious about the data collection process, I'm always happy to chat about building corpora-- please feel free to reach out.\n\n\nFrom a variety of research libraries in Hong Kong, Taipei, and across the United States (which contain considerably more than you may think on the period), I have collected and digitized a variety of Mao-era periodicals focused on legal and political-legal questions. These formed an important source base for my dissertation and my published work on the history of the Chinese public prosecutor,[^1] and I continue to use them for my book project.\n\n[^1]: These projects include, for example, [\"Supreme Supervisors? Building the People’s Procuracy, 1949–1961\"](https://brill.com/view/journals/clsr/6/1/article-p1_001.xml).\n\n### Reform Era China\n\nI have recently begun a large-scale digitization project on personnel management publications from the reform era (partially with James Gethyn Evans), focusing on the cases of three magazines: \"Personnel\", \"Organization and Personnel Research\", and \"China Organization.\"[^2]\n\n[^2]: 《人事》,《组织人事学研究》, and 《中国机构与编制》, respectively.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":"fenced","output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"self-contained":true,"reference-location":"margin","output-file":"data.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.280","editor":"visual","theme":"lumen","title":"Data","citation-location":"margin","grid":{"margin-width":"350px"}},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
