In particular, I am excited about teaching courses on: Chinese politics, Chinese foreign policy, comparative non-democracy, the political economy of development (especially in Asia), political accountability and bureaucracy, and computational methods for social science. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1 + 1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
