The Tufte handout style is a style that Edward Tufte uses in his books and handouts. Tufte's style is known for its extensive use of sidenotes, tight integration of graphics with text, and well-set typography. Quarto[^1] supports most of the layout techniques that are used in the Tufte handout style for both HTML and LaTeX/PDF output.\n\n[^1]: To learn more, you can read more about [Quarto](https://www.quarto.org) or visit [Quarto's Github repository](https://www.github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli).\n\n``` yaml\n---\ntitle: \"An Example Using the Tufte Style\"\nauthor: \"John Smith\"\nformat:\n  html:\n    grid:\n      margin-width: 350px         # <1>\n  pdf: default\nreference-location: margin        # <2>\ncitation-location: margin         # <2>\n---\n```\n\n1.  Increases the width of the margin to make more room for sidenotes and margin figures (HTML only).\n2.  Places footnotes and cited sources in the margin. Other layout options (for example placing a figure in the margin) will be set per element in examples below.\n\nThese layout features are designed with two important goals in mind:\n\n1.  To produce both PDF and HTML output with similar styles from the same Quarto document;\n2.  To provide simple syntax to write elements of the Tufte style such as side notes and margin figures. If you'd like a figure placed in the margin, just set the option `fig-column: margin` for your code chunk, and we will take care of the details for you.^[You never need to think about `\\begin{marginfigure}` or `<span class=\"marginfigure\">`; the LaTeX and HTML code under the hood may be complicated, but you never need to learn or write such code.]\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n````{.cell-code}\n```{{r}}\n1 + 1\n```\n````\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
