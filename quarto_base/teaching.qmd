I have taught a wide variety of coursework in comparative politics and political methodology to graduate students and undergraduates.

Most recently, I taught: 

- "The Politics of China," 
- "Chinese Foreign Policy," 
- "Sources and Methods for the Study of Chinese Politics,"
- "Chinese Bureaucratic Politics in Comparative Perspective" 

to graduate students at the UC San Diego School of Global Policy and Strategy.
