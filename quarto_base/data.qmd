I have collected (and make freely available to other researchers) a large variety of data on both historical and contemporary Chinese political and legal affairs. I have focused on trying to collect and clean continuous runs of newspapers, publications, and other temporally-granular sources for understanding the changing political and social landscape.

My work on Taiwan primarily relies on publicly-available but redistribution-restricted archival material that I can't freely redistribute here.

For any researchers curious about the data collection process, I'm always happy to chat about building corpora-- please feel free to reach out.

### Mao Era China

From a variety of research libraries in Hong Kong, Taipei, and across the United States (which contain considerably more than you may think on the period), I have collected and digitized a variety of Mao-era periodicals focused on legal and political-legal questions. These formed an important source base for my dissertation and my published work on the history of the Chinese public prosecutor,[^1] and I continue to use them for my book project.

[^1]: These projects include, for example, ["Supreme Supervisors? Building the People’s Procuracy, 1949–1961"](https://brill.com/view/journals/clsr/6/1/article-p1_001.xml).

### Reform Era China

I have recently begun a large-scale digitization project on personnel management publications from the reform era (partially with James Gethyn Evans), focusing on the cases of three magazines: "Personnel", "Organization and Personnel Research", and "China Organization."[^2]

[^2]: 《人事》,《组织人事学研究》, and 《中国机构与编制》, respectively.
