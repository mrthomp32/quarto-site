title: "Chinese Personnel and Organization Work Timeline (组织人事工作大事记)"
format: html
---

## What this is: 

Below, you will find an interactive visualization / explorer for personnel and organization work in the Chinese Reform Era (1978-1997). In total, there are about 2700 organization work entries and 170 personnel work entries. 

I compiled these entries from three sources I collected, scanned, OCR'd, and manually corrected: first, three timelines of significant events from the Research Office of the Central Organization Department: one covering 1978-1988, another covering 1989-1992, and a third covering 1993-1997. These were dedicated publications that cover not just relevant meetings, speeches, the release of relevant reports, and some statistics, but also the appointments and removals of significant figures. To these, I also added a less-exhaustive set of "personnel work" events from Xu and Sun's 2009 book, "Reform of China's Personnel Institutions, 1978-2008" (for the overlapping years).^[中共中央组织部研究室《党的组织工作大事记》(1978-1988,1989-1992,1993-1997); 徐颂陶 & 孙建立,《中国人事制度改革（1978-2008）》.]

As you explore, please do note that the format of the entries changes over time; while some entries were possible to separate, other entries list *multiple discrete events* that took place on the same day.^[I'd suggest making good use of the search function on the Shiny app to ensure you don't miss things, and of course the Chinese version here is the authoritative version.]

I hope that this resource will be useful anyone interested in the changes in Chinese history, the study of institutional reform, organization work, or personnel appointments in China for this period. 

## Explore the data! 

Below you should be able to explore the data in an interactive way. If it's not working or displaying correctly, please check the [shiny app](https://mthompsonbrusstar.shinyapps.io/zuzhirenshi/).

# Load and clean data
data <- read_csv("组织人事工作大事记1978-1997.csv") %>%
  rename(
    event_zh = events,
    event_en = translated_text,

## 📅 Filter Controls

```{r}
filter_slider("date", "Date Range", shared_data, ~date_start)
filter_checkbox("type", "Event Category", shared_data, ~category)
```

## 📊 Event Histogram

```{r}
plot_ly(shared_data, x = ~date_start, type = "histogram", color = ~category) %>%
  layout(bargap = 0.1,
         xaxis = list(title = "Year"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Event Count"))
```

## 📋 Event Table

```{r}
reactable(shared_data, columns = list(
  date_start = colDef(name = "Start"),
