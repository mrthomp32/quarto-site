This is ‘bureaucratism,’ a blog about the history and politics of bureaucracy and technocracy, largely in China. 

The title of the blog comes from a word long used as a shorthand for the myriad ills of bureaucracy in China and the Soviet Union (the Chinese is 官僚主义). I hope the weird political history of this term and its dynamic use over time make it a great title for the blog.
