This is ‘bureaucratism,’ a blog about the history and politics of bureaucracy and technocracy, largely in China. 

The title of the blog comes from a word long used as a shorthand for the myriad ills attributed to excessive concentration of power in the hands of bureaucrats in China, the Soviet Union, and elsewhere. In China, this is called **guanliao zhuyi** (官僚主义).
