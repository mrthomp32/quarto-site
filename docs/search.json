    "text": "I’ll keep this quick.\nWhy a blog? Because blogs are good, and I love reading them. It’s good to read people in medium- and long-form. A good thing about the internet is just letting nerds cook.\nPlus, writing is thinking, and it only seems to get harder for me these days. From where I sit, it seems like the only alternative to doing real work right now1 is posting on social media and, well, no thanks. Further, while I like the idea of other people finding and reading my work, this blog is mostly for me.\nHistorically, if I have wanted to figure something out, I have tried to write about it. Blogs are uniquely suited to the “X, what’s up with that?” type questions that have always been most interesting to me. “What’s up with that?” isn’t really a question of interest to my professional field, so I don’t do much writing of this kind now that I’ve left graduate school. Although I make no claims to any particular talent, I am very persistent, and I do sometimes make some progress in understanding something that is happening now, or that happened 50 years ago, or that might happen in the future. However, I rarely do anything with that stuff other than dump it into an Obsidian note. That seems like a waste. I could be making the internet weirder and more fun by putting them online.\nIn that spirit, my first hope is that I’ll stick with this “noodling” for my own sake. In the spirit of noodling, things might be a bit half-baked. Many things won’t make it beyond a blog-post. But hopefully what I produce will still be more fun and more productive than what I currently do with my spare time (read: doom-scrolling).\nSince I sometimes learn something that is worth explaining to someone other than myself, I also hope to write things those things here too. For now, I’ll aim to post something about why I think the study of bureaucracy is interesting and important, and then by producing a little digest of what I’ve been reading as I work."

In doing so, I revise our understanding of how the party-state’s internal checks and balances have responded to different priorities over time."

Building the People’s Procuracy, 1949-1961,” China Law and Society Review 6:1, 1-35.\nThis article interrogates the main events in procuratorial development from 1949 to 1961. Its aim is to better understand the procuracy during the Maoist era by reframing debates about its development along a spectrum: from primarily internal debates that challenged the development of the institution to external debates that challenged the role of the institution. These two dimensions also clarify how the procuracy reflected the politics of the time, especially issues of state construction and building legal knowledge, both within the state and among the “people.” The article shows that “internal” debates stemmed from the largely elite-centered and technocratic concerns of internal organization; “external” debates connected, instead, to broader concerns about the socialist legal project and the procuracy’s place in it. Reframing the institution’s history in this way enables us to understand the concepts and issues shaping the procuracy that crossed “period” boundaries and how responses to those challenges changed over time. Internal limitations (due to lack of resources) and external challenges (to develop flexible methods for accomplishing institutional goals while appearing to serve national objectives) are entwined, making the procuracy from 1949 to 1961 a site of tension between law and policy as well as a locus of contestation about the role of law in Maoist China.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The Anti-Bureaucratic Ghost in China’s Bureaucratic Machine” (2021)\n\n\n\n\n\nIza Ding & Michael Thompson-Brusstar (2021). “The Anti-Bureaucratic Ghost in China’s Bureaucratic Machine.” The China Quarterly, 248(S1), 116-140.\nThe Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) ideology, rooted in its foundational struggles, explicitly denounces “bureaucratism” (guanliaozhuyi) as an intrinsic ailment of bureaucracy. Yet while the revolutionary Party has blasted bureaucratism, its revolutionary regime has had to find a way to coexist with bureaucracy, which is a requisite for effective governance. An anti-bureaucratic ghost thus dwells in the machinery of China’s bureaucratic state. We analyse the CCP’s anti-bureaucratism through two steps. First, we perform a historical analysis of the Party’s anti-bureaucratic ideology, teasing out its substance and emphasizing its roots in and departures from European Marxism and Leninism. Second, we trace both the continuity and evolution in the Party’s anti-bureaucratic rhetoric, taking an interactive approach that combines close reading with computational analysis of the entire corpus of the People’s Daily (1947–2020). We find striking endurance as well as subtle shifts in the substance of the CCP’s anti-bureaucratic ideology. We show that bureaucratism is an umbrella term that expresses the revolutionary Party’s anxiety about losing its popular legitimacy. Yet the substance of the Party’s concern evolved from commandism and revisionism under Mao, to corruption and formalism during reform. The Party’s ongoing critiques of bureaucratism and formalism unfold in parallel fashion with its efforts to standardize, regularize and institutionalize the state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Building Socialist Legality: Political Order and Institutional Development in the Soviet and Chinese Procuracies” (2021)\n\n\n\n\n\nMargaret Hanson & Michael Thompson-Brusstar (2021) “Building Socialist Legality: Political Order and Institutional Development in the Soviet and Chinese Procuracies,” Europe-Asia Studies, 73:1, 157-177.\nWhy do some attempts to use legal institutions to exert central state control fail, while others succeed? Through a controlled comparison of the Soviet Union (USSR) and the People’s Republic of China (PRC), we analyse the institutionalization of the procuracy, an agency charged with enforcing central legal directives. We show that institutional design, competition, and political support during critical junctures created a positive feedback for the institutionalization of the procuracy in the USSR but left it weak in China. These ﬁndings contribute to our understanding of institutional development, state-building, and authoritarian legal control."

    "text": "Ongoing Projects:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Information and Autonomy in Xi’s China : The Case of Central Inspection Teams”\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthoritarian leaders face information constraints in evaluating their subordinates, and monitoring institutions are vulnerable to capture. How, then, can autocrats hold their bureaucrats accountable when popular oversight is limited? General approaches to monitoring focus on two ideal types: ‘internal’ auditing where supervisors are co-located with the supervised, and ‘external’ monitoring where supervisors are deliberately insulated from the supervised. This paper examines the effect of an increase in ‘external’ monitoring: the dispatch of Chinese Central Inspection Teams during Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption campaign. Using a staggered difference-in-differences design on data from 2012-2015, I find that inspections by central inspection teams increase the number of corruption investigations, including of provincial leaders, but that the effect decreases over time, when localities have more time to prepare. This finding has important implications for under- standing the responses of political elites to even high-profile institutional change in authoritarian regimes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Validating Automatic Text Digitization: How to Ensure Quality of Text Analysis Tasks with Automatically Digitized Text Data” (with Blake Miller)\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvances in optical character recognition (OCR) and related technologies—a suite of computational tools for digitizing raw document scans—have increased researchers’ ability to construct large corpora from undigitized source material. These technologies can dramatically expand the temporal and topical breadth of text analysis in the social sciences. This paper takes three steps towards providing best practices for applying these technologies. First, it outlines a procedure for choosing an optimal digitization pipeline using hyper-parameter search aided by transfer learning and simple language models. This consists of exploring choices in OCR model, as well as pre- and post-processing decisions. Second, it examines the efficacy of our proposed procedure for selecting a pipeline using simulations of downstream text analysis tasks (text classification, topic modeling, and dictionary methods). Third, it examines the validity and efficacy of OCR outputs from large language models (LLMs), comparing and combining them with outputs of traditional OCR surrogate models to ensure validity. Finally, it consolidates best practices for researchers digitizing new source material. We demonstrate our approach with a dataset of Papal political and policy documents from the 6th to 18th centuries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Learning by Going Out: Sub-national Diplomacy and Bureaucratic Learning in Reform China” (with James Gethyn Evans)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this multiple-paper project, we investigate role of delegations and study times originating in China’s ministries in the dramatic economic and political changes of China’s reform era. In the first paper of this project, we studied how the Chinese government leveraged information from foreign political and economic systems after 1978. Through analysis of original text from study trips from 1978 to 2010, we computationally trace the flow of ideas and text between study reports to leadership speeches, the press, and policy documents. These conclusions shed new light on the role of policy learning and bureaucratic entrepreneurship in the politics of reform and institutional change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Administrative Reform under Fire: Evidence from China”\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen are developing countries able to reform their administrative states, and when do such reforms fail? When reform coalitions fragment or fracture, how do administrative reforms proceed? This paper uses the fragmentation of the reform coalition during China’s nascent administrative reforms in the 1980s as a case study to shed light on these important questions, focusing on the development of the civil service system. Using a new panel dataset of personnel management and reform publications from 1986 to 1993, the paper examines how regime insiders and outsiders differentially altered their proposals and discussions of personnel reform before and after elite realignment in the late 1980s. The results connect the politics of elite realignment with the available of a technocratic, depoliticized consensus in public administration for the eventual passage of the Interim Regulations on Civil Servants in 1993."

Email me and I’ll send it to you.4 I suspect there might even be others! But a good source is hard to find, and I haven’t been able to track down any from the new millennium. Let me know if you have a copy!In this case, in my search I stumbled across several “chronicles of significant events” (大事记) from the Central Organization Department Research Office – one published in 1990, one published in 1993, and a final one published in 1999.4 The good folks at the Central Organization Department are, of course, just the people we’d like to hear from on the subject of consequential changes to the personnel system, although only for party members. Since it’s early and they’re famously stingy with documentation, we’ll take what we can get.\nFurthermore, as “chronicles,” they have a broad temporal view, aren’t too in-depth for getting a sense of the broad strokes, and aren’t likely any more biased than any other official source might be.\nHowever, there is one problem with them: they are unbearable to read. As someone who studies bureaucracy, I have a pretty high tolerance for boring. And I’ve read my share of snore-inducing reference volumes. But something about the disconnected entries really makes these impossible to focus on, and not just because the world is burning."

Good for bedtime reading but hard to skim unless you already know what you’re looking for.\nBeing a child of my generation, I thought “wouldn’t it be nice to be able to full-text search these, and maybe get a sense of the density of changes or events over time by type of event?”\n\n\n\n\n\nI do have some relevant skills.\n\n\nAnd so, I decided to throw together a digitized Organization and Personnel Work Chronicle.\nAfter some comparatively-painless OCR and some manual correction (scanning the books was, as usual, a pain in the neck and back), I was able to put together a segmented version of the three publications (with another, state-focused chronicle thrown in for good measure).\nI then ran the entries through the Google Translate API so that I could use them for teaching (and so folks could search with English keywords). As things stand, the entries sometimes still contain multiple discrete events, and the only classification scheme I’m using is based on what kind of book the entry came from. I’ll likely try to address those in future versions if I have time.\nI threw together a (Shiny app version)[https://mthompsonbrusstar.shinyapps.io/zuzhirenshi/] first; although also not perfect, I think this version is still superior to the version I’ve made available here on the website. In particular, since the page real-estate is not so cramped, I can keep the Chinese and the fact that entries have both start- and end-dates. But I figured it’d be fun to bring it over to the new website, and here we are."

Those people are, in order:\n\nMe and people like me (interested in personnel/cadre system reform)\nI mentioned that these information were annoying for me to read and ingest in book form. Now that I’ve digitized them and made a little interface, I can consume them in smaller temporal chunks, on a bigger screen, and search for relevant entries if I want to. That’s worth all the work by itself, frankly.\nIt’s much easier to filter for entries that mention “meetings” or that just mention the “civil service system” and read thematically rather than chronologically. Hopefully others interested in this subject find this useful also.\n\n\nPeople interested in the Org. Department\nIt turns out the Central Organization Department isn’t in the habit of making much information about how it works (or when it does anything) public very often. So finding these sources may be something of a gem for people who just want to know what was up in the COD during this period. I’ve found several references to meetings that I didn’t know happened already, and I’m just getting started.\nAs a result, I hope that putting these entries up will help clarify some of the timing and events that took place in China’s 1980s and 1990s (at least as represented in official chronicles).\n\n\nPeople interested in Central Appointments\nFinally, a big chunk of the entries are just appointments of various people to various positions. This is by design: it’s one of the most important parts of organization work.\nIn the study of Chinese politics, there’s something of a cottage-industry studying these appointments. However, getting the timing of jobs starting and finishing, especially higher up in the government, is not always easy. Data from people’s CVs and so on might contain errors, or contradict one another. These chronicles contain a lot of notes about the appointment of senior figures to various positions, as well as some officials being removed from office for a variety of reasons.\nI hope that these entries might be another useful arrow in the quiver of people interested in these topics."

    "text": "Below, you will find an interactive visualization / explorer for personnel and organization work in the Chinese Reform Era (1978-1997). In total, there are about 2700 organization work entries and 170 personnel work entries. Naturally, there’s some overlap between these entries, but they are not the same, and even when they note the same event, the events are glossed differently.\nI compiled these entries from three sources I collected, scanned, OCR’d, and manually corrected: first, three timelines of significant events from the Research Office of the Central Organization Department: one covering 1978-1988, another covering 1989-1992, and a third covering 1993-1997. These were dedicated publications that cover not just relevant meetings, speeches, the release of relevant reports, and some statistics, but also the appointments and removals of significant figures. To these, I also added a less-exhaustive set of “personnel work” events from Xu and Sun’s 2009 book, “Reform of China’s Personnel Institutions, 1978-2008” (for the overlapping years).1\nAs you explore, please do note that the format of the entries changes over time; while some entries were possible to separate, other entries list multiple discrete events that took place on the same day.2\nI hope that this resource will be useful anyone interested in the changes in Chinese history, the study of institutional reform, organization work, or personnel appointments in China for this period."
